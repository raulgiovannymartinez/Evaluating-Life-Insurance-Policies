Parameters:
- Duration (integer values from 1 to 125)
- Gender (Male or Female)
- Age (integer values from 0 to 125)
- Policy ID
- Policy Number


Questions:
- What does this Age vs. Duration Matrix mean? How is computed?
- Why index of duration starts at 1 in Survival sheet and at 0 in Value sheet?
- What is qx and qx Adj (what does the scaling by 0.01 and AverageSevetity mean?)?
- What is CF? (Cash Flow)
- Do we want to use year or duration for survival curve? Is there a difference?
	In real life duration is normally months
	survival curve: average survival for person
	Median life expectancy when px reaches 0.5
- When finding the total value of all policies: does this include all years from 2020 to 2060? Is the policy termination for cash flow defined with the zeros under DB and Premiums?
- Can you tell me a little bit more about the interface requirements? 
- Everything can be done with dataframes but wanted to check. What data structures does your team like to use? Are more appropiate to problems?
- What are the channels of visualization and visual encodings? (i.e. line chart for survival curve? Treemap to see total value comparisons for all policies?)


Definitions:
	1) px = survival probabilities
	2) qx = mortality probabilities


Data Structures:
- Ordered dictionary for holding policy ID info


Notes:
- Survival sheet values: mortality rate values


Formulas: 
	1) qx Adj -> min(1, qx*0.01*AverageSeverity)
	2) px = 1 - qx Adj 
	3) tpx[i] = px[i] * tpx[i-1], where i > 0 and px[0]=tpx[0]
	3) Prob DB = (1 - tpx) * DB
	4) Prob Prem = Premium * tpx
	5) Fees = px*1000 + (500*px if duration < 5 else 0)
	6) CF with fees = Prob DB - Prob Prem - Fees
	7) Net present value = (cash flow/(1+i)^t) - initial investment, where i = discount rate and t = number of time periods


Calculations done by the application
	1) Survival Curve -> tpx vs. Time (year or duration)
		- Per individual
		- Parameters: px, qx Adj, qx, Age, Gender, Duration, Survival value
	2) Total Cashflow
		- Option to include and exclude fees
	3) Total Value of all policies
